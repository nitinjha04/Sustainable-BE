# Production-Level Backend Template

This project is a production-level backend template built with Node.js. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern and includes features such as authentication with bcrypt, error handling for APIs, async functions, sync functions, OAuth 2.0 with Passport, and file uploading using Multer and Cloudinary.



## Features

- **MVC Pattern**: Organizes the codebase into models, views, and controllers for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Authentication with Bcrypt**: Securely hashes passwords for user authentication, enhancing security.
- **Error Handling for APIs**: Provides consistent error handling for API endpoints, improving user experience and debugging.
- **Async Functions**: Utilizes async functions for handling asynchronous operations, making the codebase more readable and maintainable.
- **Sync Functions**: Includes synchronous functions where applicable for efficiency and simplicity.
- **OAuth 2.0 with Passport**: Implements OAuth 2.0 authentication using Passport.js, allowing users to authenticate via various OAuth providers.
- **File Uploading with Multer and Cloudinary**: Handles both single and multiple file uploads seamlessly using Multer for file handling and Cloudinary for cloud storage.
- **Dockerfile**: Includes a Dockerfile for containerization, enabling easy deployment and scalability.
